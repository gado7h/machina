# Machina Target Machine

## Purpose

This document locks the active emulator target for Machina and defines the acceptance bar for hardware fidelity.

The goal is not "generic PC-like behavior." The goal is a narrow, BIOS-era IBM PC compatible machine that guest software can program through the expected registers, memory layout, and interrupt paths.

This document is the authoritative scope for emulator work. If a change does not help this target, it should be treated as out of scope unless the target is revised explicitly.

## Locked Target

Machina targets a baseline BIOS-era `80386` PC with:

- `80386`-class CPU
- BIOS boot flow
- dual `8259A` PIC interrupt controller
- `8254` PIT
- primary-channel ATA disk
- `8042` keyboard controller
- baseline IBM VGA-compatible display adapter

The intended software environment is a narrow, early-PC-compatible machine suitable for BIOS boot, real-mode bring-up, protected-mode transition, and eventually small real kernels and Linux-oriented experiments.

## Scope Boundaries

### In Scope

- real-mode reset at `F000:FFF0`
- BIOS interrupt-driven boot
- low memory layout below `1 MiB`
- port-mapped ISA-era peripherals
- text mode and standard VGA graphics programming
- protected-mode `80386` execution
- timing behavior that is stable enough for real guest software to poll and use

### Explicitly Out of Scope

- PCI
- ACPI
- APIC / IOAPIC
- VBE / SVGA / accelerated graphics
- modern chipsets and buses
- cycle-perfect analog VGA timing
- exact board-vendor quirks outside the locked baseline target

## What "Faithful" Means

For this project, a subsystem is considered faithful when it is:

- register-correct
- memory-layout-correct
- interrupt-correct
- timing-correct enough for real software

Machina is **not** targeting cycle-perfect analog hardware recreation. The acceptance bar is software-visible correctness for the locked target machine, not transistor-accurate reconstruction.

### Register-Correct

The guest sees the correct register surfaces, register indexes, read/write behavior, reset defaults, and side effects that software for the target machine expects.

### Memory-Layout-Correct

The guest sees the correct address ranges, ROM/RAM/video placement, aperture behavior, and device-visible memory aliasing/window behavior expected by the target machine.

### Interrupt-Correct

Interrupt delivery, masking, vector routing, acknowledgement, and end-of-interrupt behavior must match the target contract closely enough that real software can install handlers and rely on them.

### Timing-Correct Enough

Timing does not have to be cycle-perfect, but it must be stable and software-visible in the right ways:

- retrace polling must behave plausibly
- PIT-generated timing must be usable by real code
- keyboard/data-ready status must not be random
- storage completion state must not violate the guest-visible protocol

## Baseline Machine Contract

### CPU

- `80386`-class execution target
- starts in real mode
- supports transition into protected mode
- uses x86 segment:offset addressing in real mode
- exposes descriptor-table and control-register behavior needed for protected-mode bring-up

### Boot

- BIOS ROM mapped at `0xF0000-0xFFFFF`
- reset vector at `F000:FFF0`
- boot sector loaded to `0000:7C00`
- BIOS-owned device services during early boot

### Memory Layout

Current baseline layout:

- low RAM: `0x00000000-0x0009FFFF`
- VGA aperture: `0x000A0000-0x000BFFFF`
- BIOS ROM: `0x000F0000-0x000FFFFF`

This layout is the expected guest-visible machine map unless a later target revision changes it explicitly.

### Interrupt Layout

Baseline PIC vector bases:

- master PIC base: `0x08`
- slave PIC base: `0x70`

Baseline IRQ intent:

- IRQ0: PIT
- IRQ1: keyboard
- IRQ4: COM1
- IRQ8: RTC
- IRQ14: primary ATA

### Disk Model

- BIOS-era primary ATA channel
- boot drive default `0x80`
- CHS-facing BIOS boot path is acceptable for the target
- guest-visible ATA task-file behavior should match primary-channel expectations

### Display Model

- baseline IBM VGA-compatible register and memory model
- text mode through `0xB8000`
- graphics aperture through `0xA0000-0xBFFFF`
- no dedicated VGA IRQ in the target contract

## Subsystem Coverage Checklist

Each subsystem below has:

- a scope checklist
- a pass/fail acceptance list

Passing a subsystem means the required items are implemented and verified against guest-visible behavior.

Fail when:

- boot or runtime still depends on host shortcuts that bypass hardware state
- device behavior is individually correct but not integrated through the real machine wiring

## Definition of Done for the Target

The target machine is considered locked and implemented well enough for the current phase when:

- the active platform still matches this document
- every in-scope subsystem has an explicit pass/fail acceptance list
- future work is evaluated against this machine contract instead of a vague "PC-like" goal
- compatibility claims are made against this narrow target, not against modern PC hardware

## Change Control

Changes to the locked target should be rare and explicit.

If Machina ever expands beyond this baseline machine, update this document first and state whether the project is:

- revising the target machine, or
- adding a separate machine profile

Do not silently widen scope from "baseline BIOS-era `80386` PC" to "general modern PC emulator."
